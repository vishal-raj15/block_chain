BLOCK CHAIN :

A secure , immutable sequense of node with piece of informations.

it is a distributed ledger a network a users/comp in which each of user will have a copy of ledgers(payments/votes)
its consists of prev hash value and a hash value for each block ,in which miners verifies the validation of 
transcation .
its very difficult to get hacked because of each block can be only accessed by previous block's hash value

eg .An easy way to make a transcation .
blocks are not determined by index of block but by position of block in an array

proof of work is used to increase the difficult level which makes block_chain more fast
