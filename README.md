you have a public key and private key.
You use your private key to prove you have ownership of your public key and to access
the funds associated with that public key, just as you can use a physical key to unlock
a chest that contains your physical money.
To reiterate, public keys are used for receiving, and private keys are used for redeeming.
Received money is associated with the public key, and you can access or spend those funds
with your private key.
You are safe letting people know about your chest of bitcoins -- your public key -- so
long as you donâ€™t give them the key to get inside -- your private key.
